# Richmond Weather Station
A small repo to process/store daily data blasts from the National Weather Service (NWS) API for the Richmond, VA area. This is a tiny personal project to manually save and convert free data, so that I can get a Machine Learning Model use it. That seperate project will be completed after some data is collected, and will predict for the next week what days I will enjoy the weather and what days I won't.

## Data Source
This repo soureces data from the Public API and Datasource from the National Weather Service (NWS) provided [here](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api).

## Operations
I have a bash script running on my computer to commit + push based on two buttons I have on my desktop.
